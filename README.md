- ðŸŒ± Im a quick learner ,dedicated, determinedÂ  and one of my strengths is to interact well with peopleÂ  which also helps with effective group work.Â I've been interested in problem solving, python, c++ and i have been very enthusiastic in web development andÂ  big data lately, Â I have also attended few workshops on Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning and would love to learn more about it. IÂ would also love to learn application development and java as well.
